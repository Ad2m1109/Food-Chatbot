# I'm Hangry

## Project Description
I'm Hangry is a web application that helps users generate creative recipes based on a single ingredient input. Powered by the Gemini API, it provides a modern, user-friendly interface with features like recipe generation, saving recipes to local storage, copying recipes to the clipboard, and viewing or deleting saved recipes. The application is designed with a visually appealing, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS and custom animations.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ad2m1109/Food-Chatbot.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd im-hangry
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application. No additional setup is required as it is a frontend-only application.

## Usage Examples

- **Save Recipes**: Click "Save Recipe" on a recipe card to store it in your browser's local storage.
- **View Saved Recipes**: Click "My Recipes" to see all saved recipes, with options to copy or delete them.
